## Domain-Driven Design Based Distributed Workflow System

This project implements a distributed workflow system based on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.  
The system is structured around three bounded contexts: **Ordering**, **Shipment**, and **Invoicing**, which communicate asynchronously through domain events.  
Each context encapsulates its own domain logic, workflows, and state transitions, following a clear separation of responsibilities.

The project is developed as part of the **PSSC laboratory**, focusing on workflow modeling, domain operations, and asynchronous communication between contexts.
